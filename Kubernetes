PokeMon Go - With Kubernetes 
- MapReduce & Cloud DataFlow For Scaling-Up
- Java + Hadoop(map-reduce) + Google BigTable ==> Container - Easily Scalable.
- Challenge : Horizontal Scaling + Vertical Scaling


-- Kubernetes Architecture
Master-Slave Architecture -- Kubernetes Master -- Image Registry (Node1, Node2, Node3, Node4)

1) Master : controls the cluster and the nodes in it.
2) Nodes : host the container inside.
3) PODS : Are logical collection of containers which need to interact with each other of an Application
